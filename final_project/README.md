# 📚 ExpressBookReviews – RESTful API for Book Reviews

## Additional Notes

Apart from the normal tasks in the project, I have made the following additions:

- 📁 **Added `config.js`**  
  This file is used to store the secret key for JWT token creation. This simulates a more realistic, real-world setup where secrets are separated from the main logic.

- 🧪 **Tasks 10 to 13 (Async/Promise with Axios)**  
  These tasks are implemented at the **end of `general.js`**. Since the course did not specify where exactly to place the code for these tasks, I have added the functions at the bottom of the file for testing purposes.

- 🖼️ **Screenshots Provided**  
  A screenshot of the terminal with the function outputs has also been included for peer review clarity.
